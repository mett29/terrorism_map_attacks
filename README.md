# Terrorism Map Attacks
This kernel contains a map of all the terroristic attacks happened in the world from 1970 to 2015.

I wrote this code for the "competition" on Kaggle --> https://www.kaggle.com/START-UMD/gtd

Github doesn't render the final 3D map, go here to see full result --> https://www.kaggle.com/matt29/d/START-UMD/gtd/terrorism-attacks-in-the-world-1970-2015
